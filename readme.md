# West Bengal COVID beds report scraper

Scraped pdfs from West Bengal's Health Ministry for information on availability of COVID beds in [Private](https://www.wbhealth.gov.in/pages/corona/bed_availability_pvt) and [Government](https://www.wbhealth.gov.in/pages/corona/bed_availability) hospitals every day.

All pdfs are stored in the `pdfs` folder.

Note: West Bengal removed these pdfs from the official site and stopped uploading new ones around May 7. Since then, they have been uploading the real time updates on [another website](https://excise.wb.gov.in/chms/Portal_Default.aspx). I still need to write a scraper to pull that site.
